XU_SUMMARY_DESCRIPTION = <p>* Here "counted reads" excludes "not primary alignment", "read fails platform/vendor quality checks" and "supplementary alignment". \
<br>* Here "Average Read Length" and "Max Read Length" is adding hard clips to the read length (read length always includes soft clips). \
<br>* Here "Non Canonical Read Pair" are the pairs with same strand, ideally we prefer pair are with inwards strand. \
<br>* Here "Adaptor Trimming" is the difference between "Max Read Length" and each read length, each read length includes hard/soft clips. \
<br>* Here "Within Read Pair Overlap" excludes all soft and hard clips, to avoid the over calculation, we only count the overlapped bases \
on forward strand read. \
<br>* There is no any overlap bases between "Unmapped Reads", "Non Canonical Read Pair", "Duplicate Reads", "Within Read Pair Overlap","Soft Clipping", \
"Hard Clipping" and "Adaptor Trimming". \
<br>* The number listed on below table maybe difference to the chart shown under "FLAG" menu. "FLAG" section allows overlapping, which check each reads flags disregards \
whether it is already counted by unmapped or others; and "FLAG" section also check every inputed reads including "not primary alignment", \
"read fails platform/vendor quality checks" and "supplementary alignment". </p>
   
COLUMN_readCount_DESCRIPTION = This number excludes any reads that have a FLAG field that indicates &quot;secondary alignment&quot;, &quot;not passing quality controls&quot; or &quot;supplementary alignment&quot;. 
COLUMN_averageReadLength_DESCRIPTION = This number considers both hard and soft clipped bases to be part of the original read so they are included when calculating length. Bases removed prior to alignment (e.g. by adaptor trimming) cannot be easily measured so they are not considered to be part of the original read.
COLUMN_maxReadLength_DESCRIPTION = The calculation for this is the same as for Average Read Length so unless every read had adaptor sequence trimmed, this number should represent the number of cycles in the original sequencing run. This is only meaningful for Illumina or other platforms where the reads are originally of the same length - this does not hold for Ion Torrent or PacBio sequencing.
COLUMN_modeTlen_DESCRIPTION = The modal (most frequently occurring) TLEN value. This is usually (but not always) a good indicator of the peak of the TLEN distribution and so a useful summary metric for the distribution of fragment sizes in the library. If this value approaches or is less than twice the read length then there is a high probability that the two reads in a pair will overlap and so some sequenced bases will be wasted because you can only use sequence from one read in regions of overlap.
COLUMN_NoncanonicalReadPair_DESCRIPTION = Assumes that read pairs are oriented as per Illumina paired-end sequencing, i.e the two reads within a pair are facing inwards (5&apos;-to-3&apos;) and on opposite strands. Reads that do not match this expectation (based on the FLAG field) are counted in this category.
COLUMN_DuplicateReads_DESCRIPTION = For reads marked as duplicates, this category only counts bases that are not already tallied in another category (soft or hard clip, overlap, etc).
COLUMN_WithinReadPairOverlap_DESCRIPTION = Excludes all bases covered by hard and soft clips and only counts overlapped bases on one strand. So if a 2 x 100bp read pair overlapped by 50 bases, the assumption is that the sequenced fragment was 150 bases so 50 of the 200 sequenced bases were wasted because they were sequenced on both reads.
COLUMN_SoftClipping_DESCRIPTION = Bases that are soft clipped based on analysis of the CIGAR string.
COLUMN_HardClipping_DESCRIPTION = Bases that are hard clipped based on analysis of the CIGAR string.
COLUMN_AdaptorTrimming_DESCRIPTION = Cumulative count of the total differences between Max Read Length and individual read lengths (calculated as per column Average Read Length). This should capture any read trimming that happened before the FASTQ file was passed through an aligner.






SUMMARY_NOTES =  <P><I>Notes:</I></P><UL><LI>All figures shown as percentages are from tallies of bases, not \
reads, even for columns with "reads" in the title.</LI>\
<LI>Percentages are relative to total sequenced bases which is \
assumed to be "Read Count" * "Max Read Length"</LI>\
<LI>The following columns are exclusive, i.e. a base will only be \
counted in one category: Unmapped Reads, Non Canonical Read Pair, Duplicate \
Reads, Within Read Pair Overlap, Soft Clipping, Hard Clipping, Adaptor \
Trimming.</LI>\
<LI>The percentages listed in the summary table may differ slightly from \
the numbers shown in the FLAG tab.  The figures shown under FLAG are \
read-based but the summary table is base-based.  So a read that is a \
duplicate and has soft and hard clipping would be counted in the \
duplicate category for FLAG but would be split by base and contribute to multiple columns in the summary table.</LI></UL>\

 
UNKNOWN_ERROR = An unknown error has occurred
LOG_OPTION_DESCRIPTION = File where log output will be directed (must have write permissions)
LOG_LEVEL_OPTION_DESCRIPTION = Logging level required, e.g. INFO, DEBUG. (Optional) If no parameter is specified, will default to INFO
CANT_READ_INPUT_FILE = Cannot read the supplied input file {0}
EMPTY_INPUT_FILE = Empty input file {0}
CANT_WRITE_TO_OUTPUT_FILE = Cannot write to the supplied output file {0}
ISIZE_ERROR = No valid iSize data found in qprofiler xml file. Please check that it contains iSize split by read group

BAD_READS_DESCRIPTION = This chart shows the number of reads (y axis) containing bad bases (. or N)
BAD_QUALS_DESCRIPTION = This chart shows the number of reads ( y axis) containing quality scores of less than 10
BAD_READS_DESCRIPTION = <p>This chart shows the number of reads on the y axis containing a given number of bad bases (. or N) on the x axis.  So for example,\
 in any good sequencing run, the peak should be the leftmost bar which should show that most reads have zero bad bases. Hover over a bar to see a pop-up \
with the actual count. Note that typically the SecondOfPair plot on the right shows worse results than the FirstOfPair plot on the left.</p>
BAD_QUALS_DESCRIPTION = <P>This chart shows the number of reads on the y axis containing a given number \
of bases with bad quality scores (<10) on the x axis.  So for example, \
in a good sequencing run, the peak should be the leftmost bar which should \
show that most reads have zero low quality bases. Hover over a bar to see \
a pop-up with the actual count. Note that typically the SecondOfPair plot \
on the right shows worse results than the FirstOfPair plot on the left.<br></p>

TAG_MD_DESCRIPTION = Shows the distribution of mismatches in the MD tag, and the corresponding base sequenced.\nThe percentage values (as seen in the tooltip) are of the total mismatches found at that position taken against the total number of reads (including duplicates)
TAG_MD_DESCRIPTION = <p >Shows the distribution of mismatches in the MD tag, and the \
reported base. Since the MD tag is based on, after alignment, comparing the \
reported base against the reference base, mismatches are a mixture of \
truth (differences due to variants) and error (differences due to \
machine/chemistry mistakes).  If we assume approximately 1-in-1000 \
mismatches are due to variants (based on germline variant rate across \
the whole genome) then any mismatches above that rate are due to error. \
We would also expect that differences due to variants should \
distribute evenly across all cycles but the mismatch distribution rises \
significantly in later cycles and this can be attributed to machine and \
chemistry. <br> \
The number shown in the tooltips are for the given base but the percentage \
values s always the total for that cycle, i.e. based on the sum of all \
mismatches for that cycle across all the relvant reads.  Note that \
duplicate reads (but not secondar and supplementary) are included in \
this analysis since sequencing error is indpendent of PCR duplication.<br></P>
