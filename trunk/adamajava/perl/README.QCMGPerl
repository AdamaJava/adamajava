README.QCMGPerl
---------------

This is the single repository for all QCMG Perl projects.  It is under
the control of the 'flipper' multi-project framework so all new projects
should be created under the distros/ directory, all modules should be
placed into the single lib/ tree and the distros/flipper.xml file should
be edited to include the details of the new project.  For more details,
see the flipper.pl documentation.
