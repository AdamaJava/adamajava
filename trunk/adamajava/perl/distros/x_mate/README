The QCMG X-MATE package is a collection of perl modules and scripts
that do transcriptome and genome alignment on next-generation sequencing data.

To install this package, uncompress the install, cd into the
uncompressed directory and type the following sequence of commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The final "make install" command may require that you be root or that
you have permission to use the sudo command.
