The QCMG mirna_mate package is a collection of perl modules and scripts
that do transcriptome alignment on next-generation sequencing data
generated on the Life Technologies SOLiD platform.

To install this package, uncompress the install, cd into the
uncompressed directory and type the following sequence of commands:

   perl Makefile.PL 
   make
   make test
   make install

The final "make install" command may require that you be root or that
you have permission to use the sudo command.

If you want to install it locally, append your location to PREFIX on the 
first command. eg.
  perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/yourDir


After the mirna_mate installed, you should do below setting:
1. Make sure the mapreads is installed, otherwise this pipeline won't work;
2. Make sure the weblog is installed, otherwise final images can't create;
3. Put f2m.pl, mask_schemas_mapreads.pl in same directory; move the schemas 
folder from mapreads package to this directory as well;
4. If you installed Path::Class locally, you should move it to the same directory 
with f2m.pl. The reason is the f2m.pl will run on cluster, if you installed it's 
dependcy locally and export the local path but the cluster still won't know it.   
5. There is a testing dataset and examples of configure file if you need:
mirna_mate/test/
