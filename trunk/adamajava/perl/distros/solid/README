README

The QCMG solid package is a collection of perl modules and scripts that
are designed to be run on the head-node of the onboard cluster of a SOLiD
sequencer.  Most of these are associated with data ingestion.

To install this package, uncompress the install, cd into the
uncompressed directory and type the following sequence of commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The final "make install" command may require that you be root or that
you have permission to use the sudo command.
