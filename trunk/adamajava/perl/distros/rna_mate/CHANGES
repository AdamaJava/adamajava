-------

22 Apr 2009:

This version read different junction library for differnt tag length. but 
the junction index file format as same as the old one. 

11th Jun 2009:
the RNA_mapping.pm deal with new junction index file, in which the block is 
deleted. This means each line of the junction index decode each junction id 
and postions

**********************22nd June 2009
find a bug 

old: $i_search = $i - 2;
new: $i_search = $i - 1;

the old one won't affect the result but it check back one juction id, make the process slow. 

***********************88 Oct 2009
modify code for hg19 junciton library:

error:chr7    -10     74190   chr7_gl000195_random_74180_86517_-      1 86517   -10     74190   0       2       10,10   0,74190
correct: :chr7_gl000195_random  -10     74190   chr7_gl000195_random_74180_86517_-      1 86517   -10 74190   0       2       10,10   0,74190

>>>new code:
my $juncID = "chr7_gl000195_random_74180_86517_- ";
my @junc = split(/_/, $junctionID);
my $strand = pop(@junc);  #the last element is the strand
my $end = pop(@junc);  #the second last element is the end position
my $start = pop(@junc);  #the third last element is the start position
my $chr = join("_", @junc); #the rest are the chromosome name

>>>changed headline
   #add head line here
before: print BED "track name=\"[$self->{'exp_name'}] junctions\" description=\"[$self->{'exp_name'}] SiM matches to 60mer informative junctions\" \n";
now:    print BED "track name=\"[$self->{'exp_name'}] junctions\" description=\"[$self->{'exp_name'}] SiM matches to junctions\" \n";
