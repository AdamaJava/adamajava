------

The QCMG maintenance package is a collection of perl modules and scripts
that implement testing and consistency checks against QCMG resources
including filesystems and databases.

To install this package, uncompress the install, cd into the
uncompressed directory and type the following sequence of commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The final "make install" command may require that you be root or that
you have permission to use the sudo command.
