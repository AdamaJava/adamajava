The qAmplicon package is a utility designed to assist with the design
of primer pairs for PCR-verification of variants identified by
next-generation sequencing.  qAmplicon was originally designed to
support verification by Ion Torrent sequencing of the PCR'd amplicons
but the program is generic and shoudl work for any sequencing platform.

qAmplicon requires both BLAST and primer3 to be installed and you must
edit the perl QCMG::Automation::Qamplicon module after install to
contain the correct paths to primer3 and BLAST.  For full install 
instructions and further details on how to use the software, see the 
qAmplicon wiki page on the AdamaJava project site at SourceForge.

To install this package, uncompress the install tarball, cd into the
uncompressed directory and type the following sequence of commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The final "make install" command may require that you be root or that
you have permission to use the sudo command.  Alternatively you can
install it into another directory - see the documentation for the perl
module ExtUtils::MakeMaker and in particular, look for "INSTALL_BASE".
