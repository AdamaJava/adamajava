The QCMG coverage package is a collection of perl modules and scripts
associated with the calculation of coverage statistics for exome
enrichment experiments, initially targetting the Agilent SureSelect
platform.

To install this package, uncompress the install, cd into the
uncompressed directory and type the following sequence of commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The final "make install" command may require that you be root or that
you have permission to use the sudo command.
