# qprofiler

`qprofiler` provides quality control reporting for next-generation 
sequencing (NGS). qprofiler takes FASTQ, BAM or VCF files as input and
outputs an XML file containing summary statistics tailored to the input
file type. The VCF mode is new and is under active development so it 
should be considered experimental and subject to change.
