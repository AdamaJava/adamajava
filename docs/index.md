# Welcome to AdamaJava

The AdamaJava project holds code for variant callers and pipeline tools 
related to next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis. The code is 
being developed and maintained by the 
[Genome Informatics Group](http://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au/lab/genome-informatics/) at the [QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute](http://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au).

The code was created by the developers while they were the
bioinformatics team for Australia's participation in the International 
Cancer Genome Consortium ([ICGC](http://www.icgc.org)).

The project is being hosted on
[github](https://github.com/AdamaJava/adamajava).

Some related tools have been released as separate projects:

* [qPure](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qpure/?source=directory)

The current development team is: Felicity Newell, Oliver Holmes, Scott Wood, John Pearson.
