# qsv

`qsv` is a sensitive multi-method structural-variant detection tool that 
has been developed for whole genome paired-end or mate-pair cancer
sequencing.
This implementation of qsv integrates independent findings from soft clipping
and discordant mapped pair analyses and increases detection accuracy of
breakpoint, microhomology and non-template sequence by the incorporation
of a localized de novo assembly of abnormal reads and split contig alignment.
