XU_SUMMARY_DESCRIPTION = * Here "counted reads" excludes "not primary alignment", "read fails platform/vendor quality checks" and "supplementary alignment". \
<br>* Here "Average Read Length" and "Max Read Length" is adding hard clips to the read length (read length always includes soft clips). \
<br>* Here "Non Canonical Read Pair" are the pairs with same strand, ideally we prefer pair are with inwards strand. \
<br>* Here "Adaptor Trimming" is the difference between "Max Read Length" and each read length, each read length includes hard/soft clips. \
<br>* Here "Within Read Pair Overlap" excludes all soft and hard clips, to avoid the over calculation, we only count the overlapped bases \
on forward strand read. \
<br>* There is no any overlap bases between "Unmapped Reads", "Non Canonical Read Pair", "Duplicate Reads", "Within Read Pair Overlap","Soft Clipping", \
"Hard Clipping" and "Adaptor Trimming". \
<br>* The number listed on below table maybe difference to the chart shown under "FLAG" menu. "FLAG" section allows overlapping, which check each reads flags disregards \
whether it is already counted by unmapped or others; and "FLAG" section also check every inputed reads including "not primary alignment", \
"read fails platform/vendor quality checks" and "supplementary alignment".
   
SUMMARY_DESCRIPTION =  <P><I>Summary table columns:</I><TABLE>\
<TR><TH>Column</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>\
<TR><TD>Read Count</TD><TD>This number excludes any reads that have a \
FLAG field that indicates "secondary alignment", "not passing quality \
controls" or "supplementary alignment".</TD></TR>\
<TR><TD>Average Read Length</TD><TD>This number considers both hard and \
soft clipped bases to be part of the original read so they are included when calculating \
length.  Bases removed prior to alignment (e.g. by adaptor trimming) \
cannot be easily measured so they are not considered to be part of the original read.</TD></TR>\
<TR><TD>Max Read Length</TD><TD>The calculation for this is the same as \
for Average Read Length so unless every read had adaptor sequence \
trimmed, this number should represent the number of cycles in the \
original sequencing run. This is only meaningful for Illumina or other \
platforms where the reads are originally of the same length - this does \
not hold for Ion Torrent or PacBio sequencing.</TD></TR>\
<TR><TD>Mode TLEN</TD><TD>The modal (most frequently occurring) TLEN \
value.  This is usually (but not always) a good indicator of the peak of \
the TLEN distribution and so a useful sumary metric for the distribution \
of fragment sizes in the library.  If this value approaches or is less than \
twice the read length then there is a high probability that the two \
reads in a pair will overlap and so some sequenced bases will be wasted \
because you can only use sequence from one read in regions of overlap.</TD></TR>\
<TR><TD>Non Canonical Read Pair</TD><TD>Assumes that read pairs are \
oriented as per Illumina paired-end sequencing, i.e the two reads within \
a pair are facing inwards (5'-to-3') and on opposite strands.  Reads \
that do not match this expectation (based on the FLAG field) are counted in this category.</TD><TR>\
<TR><TD>Duplicate Reads</TD><TD>For reads marked as duplicates, this \
category only counts bases that are not already tallied in another \
category (soft or hard clip, overlap, etc).</TD><TR>\
<TR><TD>Within Read Pair Overlap</TD><TD>Excludes all bases covered by \
hard and soft clips and only counts overlapped bases on one strand.   So \
if a 2 x 100bp read pair overlapped by 50 bases, the assumption is that the \
sequenced fragment was 150 bases so 50 of the 200 sequenced bases were \
wasted because they were sequenced on both reads.</TD></TR>\
<TR><TD>Soft Clipping (CIGAR)</TD><TD>Bases that are soft clipped based \
on analysis of the CIGAR string.</TD</TR>\
<TR><TD>Hard Clipping (CIGAR)</TD><TD>Bases that are hard clipped based \
on analysis of the CIGAR string.</TD</TR>\
<TR><TD>Adaptor Trimming</TD><TD>Cumulative count of the total \
differences between Max Read Length and individual read lengths \
(calculated as per column Average Read Length).  This should capture any \
read trimming that happened before the FASTQ file was passed through an aligner.</TD></TR></TABLE></P>
 

SUMMARY_NOTES =  <P><I>Notes:</I></P><UL><LI>All figures shown as percentages are from tallies of bases, not \
reads, even for columns with "reads" in the title.</LI>\
<LI>Percentages are relative to total sequenced bases which is \
assumed to be "Read Count" * "Max Read Length"</LI>\
<LI>The following columns are exclusive, i.e. a base will only be \
counted in one category: Unmapped Reads, Non Canonical Read Pair, Duplicate \
Reads, Within Read Pair Overlap, Soft Clipping, Hard Clipping, Adaptor \
Trimming.</LI>\
<LI>The percentages listed in the summary table may differ slightly from \
the numbers shown in the FLAG tab.  The figures shown under FLAG are \
read-based but the summary table is base-based.  So a read that is a \
duplicate and has soft and hard clipping would be counted in the \
duplicate category for FLAG but would be split by base and contribute to multiple columns in the summary table.</LI></UL>\
