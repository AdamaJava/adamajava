/*
* qannotate requires snpEff and the version currently used is 4.0e
* This version of the snpEff jar file embedds a version of junit that is old,
* and qannotate's test classes use some features that the bundled version does not have.
*
* This is purely an issue with the ordering of jars on the classpath that is used by the tests
* Unfortunately, the 'testCompile' elements in the 'dependencies' block will appear in the classpath after the 'compile' elements
* A workaround for this is to define a configuration that has the desired version of the jar you care about, and then to 
* setup the compile and runtime classpath with that configuration first.
*
* more details here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7228076/how-to-specify-classpath-ordering-in-gradle
