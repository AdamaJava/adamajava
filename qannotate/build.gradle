/**
    snpEff-4.0e.jar complied with Junit4.4, which disabled our required junit library such as junit4.10.
    this also make TemporaryFolder rule stop working properly. TemporaryFolder rule requires BlockJUnit4ClassRunner 
    but junit4.4 call JUnit4ClassRunner which is old. 
    
	To solve the problem we define an customized runner which inherits all feature from BlockJUnit4ClassRunner,
	and then added it into our test class: "@RunWith(CallBlockJUnit4ClassRunner.class"
	
	There is also another simpler way that is to add our required junit to  the compile and runtime classpath. Please refer to the root build.gradle
